                    <p>A year ago, local artist Elle Luna challenged artists from around the world with her “100-Day Project,” an idea with a simple premise: do the same thing every day for a hundred days — draw a doodle, write a poem, whatever — and document the results.</p>

                    <p>San Francisco–based designer Katrina McHugh responded by making infographics based on popular song lyrics that reference the natural world, mirroring the style of vintage encyclopedias she inherited from her grandfather. The project, titled “100 Days of Lyrical Natural Sciences,” is a gorgeous and hilarious exercise in taking metaphor too literally.</p>

                    <p>How many of these song lyrics can you identify?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Lost of Children of 'Runaway Train'</h2>

                    <p>The video for Soul Asylum’s 1993 smash hit featured real missing kids. Some came home; some never did.</p>

                    <p>On a Friday morning in April 1990, Christopher Matthew Kerze, 17, told his mother, Alona, he had a headache. And so, having no reason to suspect otherwise, she agreed he could stay home from school and went to work.</p>

                    <p>When she returned at 3 that afternoon, Alona found a note on the kitchen table, written in Christopher’s scrawl:</p>
                    <blockquote>Mom,
Something important came up + feeling somewhat better.
Back by six. (Unless I get lost.)
Love, Chris</blockquote>

                    <p>The words “get lost” were underlined twice.
Alona found that the family van was gone, and their dog B.W. Bowser, who tended to be leashed during the day, had gotten loose, which she thought was odd.</p>
                
                    <p>By 10 p.m., there was still no sign of her son. Alona called her sister, who lived in the area. Then she called her husband, Jim, who had left the Kerzes’ house in Eagan, Minnesota, early that morning. A credit analyst, he’d gone to Wisconsin on business.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">I come from the land of Trump, and I know why he’s winning in rural communities; it’s not why you think</h2>

                    <p>I come from the land of Trump.</p>
                    <p>Eastern Kentucky is a region that many in this country — and in the Media — have white washed into a place where everyone is voting for the demagogue, and not many of the analyses I’ve seen have been able to truly get at the core of why so many ballots from my home region will go for Trump.</p>
                    <p>I’m from Viper, an expansive community split into four distinct sub-communities in the southern end of Perry County, Kentucky. My family has lived on the Left Fork of Maces Creek in Viper for five generations; they’ve been in Eastern Kentucky and Central Appalachia for 10.</p>
                    <p>Being who I am — a queer, liberal, woman who has vehemently supported Hillary Clinton from the get-go — you’d think I’d be angry at Trump voters. Or that I’d be confused by their choice of leader, or that I’d join in all the ridicule that’s being thrown at them. But, the thing is: I understand them. I know exactly why they’re voting for Trump.</p>
                    <p>Let me explain.</p>
                    <p>Perry County is in the heart of the eastern Kentucky coalfields, and even though the industry there is in collapse, it remains one of the top three coal-producing counties in the state. But coal is not the top employer in the county, and hasn’t been for some time. The top three employing sectors are healthcare, education and government. That’s important to remember because the narrative around coal, and the political and social capital and power surrounding it dominates life in the region.</p>
                    <p>While great wealth is generated from the coal industry in Perry County, great hardship and poverty is created in the wake of its extraction. The county — as has been the case for decades — sits at or near the bottom of nearly every single statistical measure of quality of life, including health, income, educational attainment and life expectancy. We, as well as nearly every other county in Eastern Kentucky, face some very real and urgent challenges, paramount of which is what we’ll do when the coal is gone.</p>
                    <p>And that leads me to my point:. Coal mining in Eastern Kentucky is not just a job — it’s not just what someone does. Coal mining in Eastern Kentucky is who a person is. It is a way of life, and an important foundational element of the culture. It has made brotherhoods out of men, put food on tables, sent kids to college, provided livelihoods for people who oftentimes went underground straight out of high school. Coal mining is honest work, hard work, tangible work that happens with your hands. It is thankless and grueling and raw. It is incredibly dangerous — in the short and the long term. It’s helped build America, over and over again, through economic transition after economic transition, and it’s powered the nation through it all. Coal miners are proud people — not ignorant people, not less-than people — proud.</p>
                    <p>And right now, coal miners and their families and the communities in which they live are facing an unprecedented economic shift for which they weren’t prepared. In fact, they were systematically and strategically made to be unprepared for it, and now, with their backs being forced against the wall, my people are scared.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’m scared, too.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Stigma of Genre Fiction</h2>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="https://px.multiscreensite.com/index.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F800%2F1%2A2pz2usDj_CkUuk1S9zV-_g.jpeg&hl=0" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>Like most children of my generation I was raised on a steady diet of the impossible.</p>
                    <p>From Star Wars to Disney, Narnia to the Brothers Grimm, all of my exposure to movies and literature was within the realm of the fantastical. As I grew and (allegedly) matured, my taste for these things dwindled in the shadow of new cultural discoveries such as Nirvana and Allen Ginsberg, though I still wore my love for Star Wars on my sleeve.</p>
                    <p>College was the real turning point. As I worked through syllabi loaded with Dostoyevsky and Joyce, my taste for science fiction and fantasy was on the brink of extinction. I derided former lifelong favorites like Stephen King as mass market garbage and refused to touch any form of media that didn’t warrant a thesis-level analysis. In a word, I became insufferable.</p>
                    <p>After graduation that attitude thankfully disappeared, due in large part to the Harry Potter series. After many of my peers whose opinion I greatly respected began to gush about the just-released “Half-Blood Prince”, I bit the bullet and picked up the series’ first volume, to win the argument if nothing else. Instead I surrendered my pretensions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Genre fiction has always been the ghetto of literature, to paraphrase perennial legend Ursula K LeGuin.</strong></p>
                    <p>This stigma can likely be traced directly to the pulp magazines of the early 20th century. Titles such as “Weird Tales” and “Amazing Stories” famously pumped out scandalous tales of aliens and terrors on the cheapest paper possible to take as much pocket money from American youth as possible.</p>
                    <p>Their lurid covers with buxom women at the mercy of fanged beasts hardly screamed timeless classics, so this academic ostracism can, to a degree, be forgiven. Hidden between those outlandish covers were the seeds of relevancy, though. Fritz Leiber, A.E. Vogt, Ray Bradbury, and Isaac Asimov are just a few of the writers who got their start in those inauspicious pages.</p>
                    <p><strong>What has been overlooked until recently is that science fiction and fantasy possess an ability not found in any other literary subdivision: the license to create an imaginary scenario to present a real world problem in a new, objective way.</strong></p>
                    <p>When a conflict is put into a “social vacuum” by virtue of an imaginary and impossible setting (an interstellar war, a boarding school for magical children, etc.), the audience is allowed to leave their preconceived notions at the door and evaluate the situation on its own merits.</p>
                    <p>This license is something the original Star Trek utilized many times. The series tackled subjects as heady as racism and rampant nationalism in an original, thought-provoking way by virtue of science fiction’s capacity for world building. Even the makeup of the cast was novel; the Enterprise’s bridge was a racial melting pot that gave audiences a glimpse of what a united, post-national world could look like. In that vein, the series also famously broadcast the first interracial kiss on American television, which was shared between William Shatner and Nicole Nichols.</p>
                    <p>In the novel “The Left Hand of Darkness” by LeGuin, a human envoy is sent to the planet Winter to treat with an alien race that undergoes physical changes to their sex several times throughout their life. This ambisexual nature obviously influenced their society’s development to a large degree, and the human envoy’s attempts to navigate their social and cultural mores successfully are the bulk of the story.</p>
                    <p>As the envoy grapples with understanding a society with a literally alien sense of gender and sexuality, the reader does as well. The planet Winter then becomes an analogue for sexual minorities here on Earth, allowing the audience to (ideally) reconsider their views on the subject.</p>
